# Master-s-Thesis---Uncertainty-Categorization-and-Visualization-in-Penicillin-Production-IndPenSim-
Overview
This project is built upon the simulation of penicillin production as outlined in the paper ["Modern day monitoring and control challenges outlined on an industrial-scale benchmark fermentation process"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135418305106). The simulation was conducted in MATLAB 2018b, and the data generated from the simulation can be found on [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pdnjz7zz5x/1).
