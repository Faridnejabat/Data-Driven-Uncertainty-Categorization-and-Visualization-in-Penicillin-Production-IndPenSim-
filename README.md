# Master-s-Thesis---Uncertainty-Categorization-and-Visualization-in-Penicillin-Production-IndPenSim-
## Overview
This project is built upon the simulation of penicillin production as outlined in the paper ["Modern day monitoring and control challenges outlined on an industrial-scale benchmark fermentation process"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135418305106). The simulation was conducted in MATLAB 2018b, and the data generated from the simulation can be found on [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pdnjz7zz5x/1).
## Data Description
The data represents a 100,000 litre penicillin fermentation system (referred to as IndPenSim) and is designed for advanced data analytics, machine learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applicable to the biopharmaceutical industry.

Key Features:
100 batches of data generated using various control strategies:
Batches 1-30: Controlled by a recipe-driven approach.
Batches 31-60: Controlled by human operators.
Batches 61-90: Controlled by an Advanced Process Control (APC) system using Raman spectroscopy.
Batches 91-100: Include faults and process deviations.
Data Size: ~2.5 GB
Source: IndPenSim provides a realistic simulation including Raman spectroscopy data for developing and evaluating control solutions in biotechnology.
