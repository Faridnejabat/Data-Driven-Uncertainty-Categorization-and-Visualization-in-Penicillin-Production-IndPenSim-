# Master-s-Thesis---Uncertainty-Categorization-and-Visualization-in-Penicillin-Production-IndPenSim-
This repository contains the analysis and simulation work for my masterâ€™s thesis, "Uncertainty Categorization and Visualization in Industrial-Scale Fed-Batch Fermentation Simulations (Penicillin Production)." This work aims to analyze uncertainty across 100 batches of simulated penicillin production and provide insights into batch performance using statistical and machine-learning techniques.
